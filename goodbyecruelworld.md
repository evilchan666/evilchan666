Goodbye world,

I am 1337 h4x0r evilchan666.
Probably the laziest coder on the planet.
I'm a generalist and I study a wide array of computing sub categories.
Been writing programs sporadically since 2011, but haven't reached a point in 
which I can code without external references for guidance, generally due
to laziness and lack of focus. 

By 2025 I hope to be coding my Metaverse environment, as well as be able to
implement deep learning and other complex programs.
